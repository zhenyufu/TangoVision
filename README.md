# TangoVision
HackDuke Hackathon Project: Using Google Tango depth sensing to help the visually impaired: [demo video](https://devpost.com/software/tango-vision)


## What it does
* Google Tango knows where it is and how it is moving through space. 
* Tango Vision guides users past close objects within 1.5 meters with turning, warning and vibration cues.


## Challenges
* Memory issues where the Tango was storing data locally and had to be restarted every ~20 debug cycles.     
* Instabilities in the API and Tango device: https://developers.google.com/project-tango/apis/known-issues?hl=en
